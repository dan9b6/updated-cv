                    I didn't take the most conventional route into Software

                    I covered a wide range of skills and coding languages. By
                    the end of the course, I had created three web applications.

                  I went to my first ever football match - Arsenal vs
                  Southampton. Since my trip to this beautiful stadium, being an
                  Arsenal fan has definitely become more and more painful over
                  the years. I hope that being a fan of this club won't be a
                  dealbreaker!

                <p>
                  My first job was landed. I became a paperboy! Monday to
                  Saturday at 6:30am I would make my way down to my local
                  newsagents to collect my round and get underway. Wasn't the
                  dream role - but that Â£25 a week went a long way back then.

                <p>
                  I was (and still am) obsessed with football. Fortunately, I
                  had the opportunity to play for Yeovil FC Academy. During this
                  time I played against a number of academy teams at the highest
                  level. However, I didn't quite make the cut.

                <p>
                  I had finished my GCSE's! I managed to get 11 GCSE's all A-C -
                  including an A in Maths, Biology and P.E. So to celebrate my
                  exams, me and a few friends went to Cardiff for the Olympic
                  Games to watch GB take on South Korea. Unfortunately they lost
                  5-4 on penalties.

                <p>
                  I began my first job in Educational Sales at The Training
                  Room. This was my first exposure to the world of tech.
                  Originallly I began selling Personal Training courses.
                  However, I then moved into selling Software & Web Development
                  training courses. Whilst working at The Training Room I worked
                  with a team of Sales Executives trying to help people change
                  their career's and enter into the world of IT. It was during
                  this time that I started to look into these areas myself and
                  my interest in the sector began to increase.

                <p>
                  At the start of 2019, I decided to go travelling in Thailand.
                  It was a truly incredible experience and during my time I
                  visited many islands, met people from around the world, many
                  adventure days and of course - went to many bars. However,
                  during my time in Asia, it gave me a real chance to reflect on
                  what I wanted to do when I got back home - which is when I
                  started looking into roles in tech.

                <p>
                  I started learning how to code. I became a regular at
                  CodeAcademy and Stack OverFlow. First of all, I started to
                  learn HTML and CSS. I found it incredibly rewarding building
                  something from nothing and having it appear in front of me. I
                  was creating a number of static web pages and trialling
                  different effects and animations that I could use for future
                  websites. I then moved onto basic Javascript. This is when I
                  knew I wanted become a Web Developer and get some professional
                  training and qualifications.

                <p>
                  I graduated as a Web Developer through Ironhack Tech Bootcamp
                  - Lisbon. During the course I covered a number of technologies
                  and languages. Such as: HTML CSS/SASS Javascript React JS Node
                  Express Mongo DB and many other skills which you can find on
                  this link. This whole experience was a real eye-opener for me.
                  I never thought it would be possible to learn as much as I did
                  during this bootcamp and leave with three fully functional
                  projects.

                <p>
                  I began an apprenticeship with BenDando. Currently, most of
                  the work I am doing involves using React and Next JS. I am
                  heavily involved in the front-end development to - where I am
                  using HTML, CSS/SASS, JS and other Web Design tools such as
                  MDB Bootstrap. I have also had a little exposure to Shopify
                  and Sanity - which is a headless CMS software.

                <p>
                  I started my first web agency role at Appius. During my time
                  at Appius, I have been exposed to a number of projects. Over
                  the last year, my focus with Appius has been HTML, SCSS and
                  Javascript - with a few opportunities to work with Vue.js.
